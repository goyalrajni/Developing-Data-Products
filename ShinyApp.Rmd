##Summary

For the Developing Data Products Course Project, I have developed a Shiny Application to calculate the Body Mass Index.


##Application Purpose

My Shiny application allows the user to choose their weight, along with their height in metres. After doing so, the application will reactively display:

1. Your body mass index.


2. If you're underweight, normal, overweight or obese.



##Viewing and Running the Shiny App

The shiny application I developed has been published to the Shiny server <a href="http://rajnigoyal.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp "> here </a>

Alternatively, to reproduce this application locally you will need to install all of the relevant packages (see the Getting Started with Shiny Apps documantation for details). Next, you can run the ui.R and server.R files located in the same repository as this document to run the application locally.
